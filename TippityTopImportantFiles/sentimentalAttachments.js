/*
Welcome to Visual Studio Code, Expo components! This software isn't as jealous, manipulative and
downright evil as Expo, so you'll definitely like it here! For components like Mr. Fatal Firebase Error
(I thought he was assassinated), who has recently been resurrected, keep your messed up nose out
of this app please and thank you.

Otherwise, welcome to those components that have been mutated, and I hope you like your great new blue
background. Blue's supposed to be the colour of peace, which is not what I'm expecting from you guys,
but I'm still going to be optimistic

And for my old friends, the elks...

Grass, grass, grass, grass, elk, grass, grass, grass, grass, LETTUCE! 
There. More than enough grass

And for my other friends, the lynxes...

Salad, salad, salad, lynx.

You're going to have to eat salad for now... I'm not letting you gobble up mice

Back to sentimentalAttachments.js...

There's a random screen open, a black one, which I have ABSOLUTELY no idea about. That's weird, maybe
I should cancel it or something. It's DEFINITELY not important, so that should be fine

(Is that humiliating enough?)

Yeah should be fine. OH YAY! IT LOADED!!! SURPRISE!!!

This is absolutely not a waste of time, and whoever calls it one is in danger of being bitten by a
lynx. I've got a cool new Dracula theme, which has a nice contrast

Sorry Mr. Fluffy Face, I shouldn't have blamed you for Mr. Fatal Firebase Error

Time to humiliate command prompt some more!!!

Oh look, there's the blank boring screen again! Must not be very important, but maybe I'll leave
it there for now. So sad and lonely. Maybe I'll give it a lynx for company

Hey, Command Prompt! Do you want a lynx?

No? Yes? Y? N?

rollbackFailedOptional

Sorry Command Prompt

I've got you now, slippery criminal!!!!! You're going to the virtual jail.js

Hello Mr. Fluffy Face! I've got you some toast!!! It's better than mice at least, and it's just a
LITTLE burnt round the edges to make it nice and crispy. It comes with free butter too! Melty, gooey
yumminess, running all around crispy toast! (Wow my mouth's watering now)

Hello again Expo components! I'm a bit bored, since I've messed around with the stylesheets and the
appearance enough
