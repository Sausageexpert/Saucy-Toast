/*
Welcome, one and all, to this completely legitimate marriage. I have absolutely no idea what I'm
supposed to be doing, but we can start by throwing rice around, since that seems like a good idea.

After that we have virtual refreshments served in the virtualJail file, so you can hop over there

I'm also not sure if Ms. Squiggly Underline is married, so if she is... that might be a teeny-weeny
bit of a problem, but no one really cares, since everyone likes weddings (for the food mostly, but still)

So if Ms. Squiggly Underline is married (poor husband), then we might have to cancel this programme.
Or we could just go ahead and marry off her sister, who is also very conveniently named Ms. Squiggly
Underline (they were twins, and their parents couldn't think of another name).

So I think I'll write some code now

if(Mrs.SquigglyUnderline.isMarried()){
    alert("Oops");
} else {
    alert("Yay! Let's go ahead with the wedding then!")
}

That's a great function! Anyway, time for the best part! REFRESHMENTS!
